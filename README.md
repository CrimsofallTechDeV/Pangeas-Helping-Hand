# Pangeas Helping Hand

Pangeas Helping Hand is a VR game framework with several mini-games and interaction prototypes. This repository contains the C# source and Unity project files used while building the project. The project is structured as a Unity VR experience and targets common VR runtimes (OpenXR, SteamVR, Oculus).

Quick start (for collaborators)
1. Ensure you have a compatible Unity Editor version. Recommended: Unity 6.3 (6000.3.3f1) LTS or later (confirm exact version with project maintainers).
2. Install a VR runtime/provider (OpenXR, SteamVR, or Oculus Integration) according to the target headset.
3. Clone the repository (collaborators only):
   git clone https://github.com/Crimsofall-Technologies/Pangeas-Helping-Hand.git
4. Open the project in the Unity Editor and allow the editor to resolve packages.
5. Open the main scene in Assets/Scenes/ (ask a maintainer for the exact scene path if it’s not obvious).
6. Configure Player Settings → XR Plug-in Management to match the target runtime.
7. Enter Play mode in the Editor or create a build (File → Build Settings).

Non-collaborator access
- You may view the code on GitHub for review, learning, or evaluation purposes.
- You may not clone, copy, fork, or use the code outside of the GitHub web interface without written permission from the repository owner.
- For access beyond viewing (cloning, contributing, running locally, or redistribution), request collaborator access as described in “Requesting access”.

Project structure (typical Unity layout)
- Assets/ — Scenes, prefabs, scripts (.cs), art assets
- Packages/ — manifest.json and package configurations
- ProjectSettings/ — project-wide Unity settings
- .gitignore — recommended Unity-specific ignores (if present)

Contributing
Contributions are restricted to approved collaborators only.
- If you are a maintained contributor or a client-assigned developer, request collaborator access from the repository owner or open an issue to request access (if issues are enabled).
- Once you are granted collaborator status, follow the repository’s branch and PR workflow (create feature branches off main, open pull requests, request reviews).

Requesting collaborator access
- Open an issue in this repository requesting collaborator access and include:
  - Your GitHub username
  - Role (developer, tester, artist)
  - Reason for access and expected changes
- Or contact the owner directly.
